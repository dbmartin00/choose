Chapter One

Chest heaving, you pivot from the top of the cliff onto its sandy side.  The ocean is a few hundred feet below you, a steep drop from your location.  You can hear your pursuers.  By picking your way down the cliff, you could reach the beach and make a run for it.  The cliff runs for miles along this stretch of coast, just the chance you need to elude your pursuers.  On the other hand, you could circle back to the hotel.  They didn't see you duck over the edge, so you could hide for awhile, then double back.

Do you [[1-2] hide, then double back to the hotel], or [[1-3] climb down the cliff and escape on the beach]?
