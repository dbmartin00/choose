The wedding is for a hipster and an Indian bride.  Her family dwarves his.  The guests are a racial mix, and have made good use of the open bar.  At this phase of the festivities, nobody is asking any questions about an invitation. You manage a scotch and soda and press through the crowd towards the dance floor.

You see the ring in the middle of "Come On, Eileen!"  The man is dancing with a woman you assume is his daughter.  She is in an orange dress, walking and then running through the song's long build.  The logo on the ring is unmistakable.  It belongs to Mirrorly corporation, the startup loboratory working on hypersleep technology, or "stassis".  You finger the bejeweled key in your pocket.  They developed the secret to make stassis possible, and you stole it.  The world will be a better place without it.

While you don't recognize the man, you know he must work for Mirrorly.  Maybe you can coerce him into helping you escape.  [[?-?] Waylay the man in the hotel hallway and push him into answering your questions], [[?-?] or head to the valet stand to steal a car].
