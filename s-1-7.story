Inside a Cave

The water does recede, but the noise of the water and damp environment inside the cave make it impossible to sleep.  You are cold and wet, and you know you can't stay here for much longer or catch hypothermia.  You leave the cave and walk along the shore, but at night it's too hard to keep crossing in the water.

You find a ravine with climbable slopes.  With difficulty, you're back on top of the ocean cliffs, several miles from the hotel.

It's almost twenty miles to the Pigeon Point lighthouse.  After a few miles on the beach, you work your way back to the highway.  Being seen is a risk, but the coast is impassable.  You convince a little old lady to give you a lift to Pigeon Point, about twenty minutes south.  It's unlikely that your pursuers will look for you at the lighthouse.

[[1-8] You risk it and head towards the lighthouse], [[1-5] or you can return to the hotel and crash the wedding.]
