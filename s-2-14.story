Driving to UCSF

Thomas owns a pristine Nissan sedan.  The campus is only a few minutes away, but the two of you are starving.  You make a stop at Good Luck Dim Sum and chow down on dumplings and radish cakes.

Laurel Village is busy as always and you recognize the bookstore you used to haunt when you lived in this part of the city.

Thomas drops you off in front of the building and you use your burner phone to call Dr. G.
