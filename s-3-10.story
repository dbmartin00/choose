Swimming

It's a small pool, but the truth is that you are not a good swimmer.  In your closes and partially drunk, you can barely give your nose above the water.

You never reach the ladder at the far side of the pool.  Instead, one of the sleepers uses a long poll to reach you and pull you to the side of the pool.  From there, several men reach down to haul you back out of the water.

Hotel security has been called.  You're not the first person to have gone swimming this pool, and they have the cops there before you can try another get away.
