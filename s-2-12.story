Opening the File

The contents of the key is not one file, but hundreds.  They're organized by phase.  The early phases go over screening candidates for stassis: what kind of health problems could disqualify a candidate (e.g. pace makers, brain injuries, and intoxication).  In later phases, it detailed the chemistry behind stassis itself.  Stassis is not cryogenics.  Nothing is frozen.  Instead, the chemicals catalyze the body to go into hibernation on its own.  The heart beat slows down to once every ten minutes.  The subject is almost completely unconscious.  The "almost" is due to some subjects reporting that they had dreams during stassis.  You have Thomas print that section.

The final phases discuss waking a subject from her chemically induced sleep.  There are few side effects, but they often include temporary hearing loss, fuzzy vision, and disorientation.  Nothing surprising for a person that has slept for a decade.
