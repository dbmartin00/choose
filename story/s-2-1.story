Costanoa

You wake early and leave the hostel.  The rising sun casts a slat against the top of the lighthouse, giving the appearance that it is on fire.  You're hungry, and you remember that Costanoa is nearby.  You walk across the highway and up the long, Eucalyptus-lined driveway to the restaurant at the top of the hill.  They're serving breakfast, and you order up a five egg omelette then begin pouring coffee down your throat.

To decipher the contents of the key, you'll have to get to San Francisco.  You have a friend who lives near USF that can help you, but you're sure you can't walk without being caught.  There are no good bus or train routes.  You can't go back to a vehicle you've used, too risky.

Fortified by your breakfast, you step out of the restaurant.  There is a parking lot and you notice that a couple is nearby packing up their stuff to check out.  Do you want to [[2-2] beg for ride], or [[2-3] hitch a ride north on Highway 1.]
