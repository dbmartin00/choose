Swimming

It's a small pool, but the truth is that you are not a good swimmer.  In your clothes and partially drunk, you can barely keep your nose above the water.

You never reach the ladder at the far side of the pool.  Instead, one of the sleepers uses a long poll to reach you and pull you to the side.  From there, several men reach down to haul you back out of the water.

Hotel security has been called.  You're not the first person to have gone swimming this pool, and they have the cops there before you can try another get away.

[[2-7] You take your chances with the police], or [[3-9] you decide on a truce with the sleepers].
