A Foot Chase

Outside the building, the streets are busy with midday foot traffic.  This is Market Street, and you can run, but you can't hide.  There are street cars, and they are packed, difficult to enter and to exit.

The cable car is an ideal solution.  You can hop the car while it's in motion, dangle, and be ready to jump off at a moment's notice.

Nobody is on your tail as you leave the building.  You make it to Powell Street at a run and hop one of the passing cars from the rear, out of sight of the conductor.  It takes you up Nob Hill.  

[[3-6] Double back to the Civic Center], or [[3-7] Enter the Fairmont and hide in the Tonga Room.]
