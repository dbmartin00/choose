Zephyr Cafe

The Zephyr Cafe is empty.  A woman at the counter takes your order for a double nonfat latte, and you settle into one of the wooden booths facing the windows.  It's overcast in San Francisco, but the kind of fog that will usually burn off by midday.

If you have a burner phone, you can [[2-10] call your friend to meet you at cafe].

Otherwise, you know your friend comes to this cafe every morning, so you can [[2-9] wait for them to arrive.]
